**Shipped version:** Always the last stable one. The last compiled version is retrieved from [this directory](https://releases.domoticz.com/releases/?dir=./beta)
Once installed, **updates from the uptream app are managed from within the app.**. Yunohost upgrade script will only upgrade the Yunohost package. 


## Configuration

All the configuration of the app take place inside the app itself.


## Documentation

 * Official documentation: Please use the [wiki](https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Main_Page) and [user manual](https://www.domoticz.com/DomoticzManual.pdf) for further info.
 * YunoHost documentation: If specific documentation is needed, feel free to contribute.

## YunoHost specific features

#### Supported architectures

Both ARM and x86 architectures should be supported.
Compiled sources are directly downloaded by the package.

## Limitations

* No user management nor LDAP integration This function is [not planned to be implemented into the app](https://github.com/domoticz/domoticz/issues/838), hence it's not planned into the package neither.
* Backup cannot be restored on a different machine type (arm, x86...) as compiled sources are different
